Nudge A Delegate for Bernie Sanders

## How to contribute
Your help is needed in keeping this repository up to date. A good source of information can be found
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Democratic_Party_superdelegates,_2016#List) on wikipedia.
If you see a name in the list on wikipedia that is not in this list, please issue a pull request updating
this list. Similarly, if you find that a delegate has flipped toward Sanders, we need to remove that person's name.

To add names, find the state the superdelegate is representing within
[index.html](https://github.com/rthbound/nudge/blob/gh-pages/index.html) and add a link, following the pattern with
other names.
